We can crawl a website using Selenium and Beautiful Soup package in python.
Before we get into crawling,the required website should be get using request method.
Then after,as each website frontend is made using html,css files.
Every element in the website has arranged tags such as <h1>,<a>,<img> etc.
So to extract particular element from website the tag in which the element is placed is to be noted.
And at the same time each tag has various id's and class names.
So to extract particular element (tag_name,id_name) of that element should be mention in the methods of Beautiful Soup.
